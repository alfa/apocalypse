== Installation Instructions ==
This documents describes the installation process for MaNGOS on Unix platforms
using the standard Makefile build process. This includes systems like Fedora
Core, Debian, FreeBSD, etc.

=== Configuring ===
MaNGOS uses the standard autoconf configure, thus all normal autoconf options
apply. In common we will assume that you do have a working C++ compiler on
your systems. If not, GCC (http://gcc.gnu.org/) is your friend.

There are several programs and libraries required in order to compile MaNGOS
successfully:

 * pthread development package (headers) are required, as MaNGOS uses threads.
   Note: on some systems, the phtread development files are part of the glibc
   packages.
 * zlib development package (headers) are required, as we use them for data
   compression.
 * MySQL development package (headers) are required, because we are using this
   backend for keeping world data.
 * OpenSSL development package (headers) are required, because we are using them
   for authenticating the game client.

Optional packages to enhance the functionality of MaNGOS are:

 * Curses or termcap headers are not required but highly recommended because
   you'll get a much nicer console input/output.
 * Python 2.4 development package (headers) are required to build the Python
   scripting library if you want to script the MaNGOS world daemon using Python.
   This will also require the included PyCXX package.

Optional packages included in MaNGOS as they are not installed or available on
several systems include:

 * LUA and tolua++ package are not required, but highly recommended if you want
   to build and use the LUA scripting library and create .lua scripts for the
   world daemon.
 * PyCXX package is not required, but highly recommended if you want to build
   and use the the Python scripting library.

Here's a list of options that is specifically useful when configuring MaNGOS:

 --sysconfdir=/etc/mangos
   
   This will set the directory where the compiled daemons will look for the
   configuration files. By default it's something like /usr/local/etc.

 --enable-debug
   If you use this option, the DEBUG_PRINTF macro and some other debugging
   macros will be enabled. This means you will get much more information about
   what goes on, so use this option if something doesn't work and you don't
   understand what happens.

Here's a sample sequence that configures MaNGOS for a debug build (this is
usually called cfg-debug.sh):

CFLAGS="-g -Wall -std=c99 -Wno-long-long" \
CXXFLAGS="-g -Wall -std=c++98 -Wno-long-long" \
LDFLAGS="-g" ./configure --sysconfdir=`pwd`/debug --enable-debug

if [ ! -d debug ]; then
	mkdir debug
	cp bin/*.conf debug/
	echo "Don't forget to modify the config files in debug/"
fi

To configure for production use it would be something like:

OPT="-s -O3 -ffast-math -Wall -std=c99 -Wno-long-long"
CFLAGS="$OPT" \
CXXFLAGS="$OPT -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-exceptions" \
LDFLAGS="-s" ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/mangos

I especially recommend the -fno-exceptions switch since the resulting
executable will be around 20% smaller and we don't use exceptions anyway.

=== Compiling ===
Well, it should be fairly simple if you got all the pre-requisites. Just type

$ make

If you have a problem during compilation, we can't tell you what to do. Figure
it out yourself. If we would know in advance what problems you would encounter,
we would fix it in advance, or put a warning message in configure at least.

Until this development branch will be merged into the trunk of our SubVersion
repository, no support will be provided.

Thank you for understanding.

=== Installing ===
Since there is nothing installable yet, there are no instructions available.

Makes sense, doesn't it?
