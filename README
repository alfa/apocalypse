== Welcome to MaNGOS ==

MaNGOS (the Massive Network Game Object Server) is an Open Source reference
implementation for a MMORPG server system. Please see the file COPYING for
license details.

The required SQL files for creating the database backend are included in the

make sure you as well take a look at the SQL files in the sql/updates/ sub-
directory.
