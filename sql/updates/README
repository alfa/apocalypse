== Database Updates ==
This folder contains SQL files which will apply required updates to your MySQL
database, whenever the MaNGOS database structure has been changed or extended.

To see if you need an update, the file names have been given a fixed structure
that should enable you to see if you need an update or not.

=== File name descriptin ===
File names are divided into two parts. First part of the name, is the table that
needs and update or has been added. The second part is the revision that will
need the update. See an example below:

         character_spell-1123.sql
         |                  |
The table character_spell   |
will need an update.        |
                            |
                            MaNGOS revision 1123 or older will need this update.
                            Any release after revision 1123, e.g. 1124 or 1137,
                            already includes this update in the default database
                            file mangos.sql.
