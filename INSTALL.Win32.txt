== Installation Instructions ==
This documents describes the installation process for MaNGOS on Windows
using Visual C++. This includes Visual C++ 2003 and Visual C++ 2005 (Express
Edition working, too).

=== Configuring ===
MaNGOS uses the Visual C++ compiler to build the binaries. If you do not
have Visual C++, a free Express Edition of Visual C++ 2005 is available at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/.

Visual C++ 2003 Toolkit provides an alternative command line environment,
but as of writing this document, the toolkit has been replaced by the VC++
2005 Express Edition and only is available from some download mirrors.

There are several programs and libraries required in order to compile MaNGOS
successfully:

 * zthread development package (headers) are required, as MaNGOS uses
   threads.
 * zlib development package (headers) are required, as we use them for data
   compression.
 * MySQL development package (headers) are required, because we are using
   this backend for storing all data.
 * OpenSSL development package (headers) are required, because we are using
   them for authenticating the game client.

Optional packages to enhance the functionality of MaNGOS are:

 * LUA 5.1 development package (headers) are required to build the LUA
   scripting library. This will also require the included tolua++ package.
 * Python 2.4 development package (headers) are required to build the Python
   scripting library. This will also require the included PyCXX package.

If you do not have all these dependencies installed, you may download a huge
dependency package from the MaNGOS website.

There are two build configurations available for MaNGOS.

 Release (Win32)
   
   This will build MaNGOS and all its' dependencies in Release mode, thus all
   information output useful to developers will be removed as well as debug
   data will not be included in the resulting binaries.

 Debug (Win32)
   If you use this option, the DEBUG_PRINTF macro and some other debugging
   macros will be enabled. This means you will get much more information about
   what goes on, so use this option if something doesn't work and you don't
   understand what happens.

=== Compiling ===
Well, it should be fairly simple if you got all the pre-requisites. Open the
"Build" menu and select "Batch Build". In the dialog, either select all
build configurations for "Release (Win32)" to build binaries for running
MaNGOS or select all build configurations for "Debug (Win32) to build
binaries suitable for running debug sessions.

If you have a problem during compilation, we can't tell you what to do.
Figure it out yourself. If we would know in advance what problems you would
encounter, we would fix it in advance, or put a warning message in configure
at least.

Until this development branch will be merged into the trunk of our
SubVersion repository, no support will be provided.

Thank you for understanding.

=== Installing ===
Since there is nothing installable yet, there are no instructions available.

Makes sense, doesn't it?
