== Installation Instructions ==
This documents describes the installation process for MaNGOS on Windows using
Visual C++. This includes Visual C++ 2003 and Visual C++ 2005 (Express Edition
working, too).

=== Configuring ===
MaNGOS uses the Visual C++ compiler to build the binaries. If you do not have
Visual C++, a free Express Edition of Visual C++ 2005 is availaable at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/.

Optional packages to enhance the functionality of MaNGOS are:

 * Python 2.4 development package (headers) are required to build the Python
   scripting library if you want to script the MaNGOS world daemon using Python.
   This will also require the included PyCXX package.

Optional packages included in MaNGOS as they are not installed or available on
several systems include:

 * LUA and tolua++ package are not required, but highly recommended if you want
   to build and use the LUA scripting library and create .lua scripts for the
   world daemon.
 * PyCXX package is not required, but highly recommended if you want to build
   and use the the Python scripting library.

There are two build configurations available for MaNGOS.

 Release (Win32)
   
   This will build MaNGOS and all its' dependencies in Release mode, thus all
   information output useful to developers will be removed as well as debug
   data will not be included in the resulting binaries.

 Debug (Win32)
   If you use this option, the DEBUG_PRINTF macro and some other debugging
   macros will be enabled. This means you will get much more information about
   what goes on, so use this option if something doesn't work and you don't
   understand what happens.

=== Compiling ===
Well, it should be fairly simple if you got all the pre-requisites. Open the
"Build" menu and select "Batch Build". In the dialog, either select all build
configurations for "Release (Win32)" to build binaries for running MaNGOS or
select all build configurations for "Debug (Win32) to build binaries suitable
for running debug sessions.

If you have a problem during compilation, we can't tell you what to do. Figure
it out yourself. If we would know in advance what problems you would encounter,
we would fix it in advance, or put a warning message in configure at least.

Until this development branch will be merged into the trunk of our SubVersion
repository, no support will be provided.

Thank you for understanding.

=== Installing ===
Since there is nothing installable yet, there are no instructions available.

Makes sense, doesn't it?
