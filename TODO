//// DONT CRASH CLIENT BUT DONT WORK:

- Fix trade (fix or build from scratch?).
- Fix honor system (fix or build from scratch?).
- Fix items (they need to have the right use for each character, currently
  any char can use any item).
- Fix duel (fix or build from scratch?).
- Fix mob drops (they still give out gold insted of the correct items).
- Find out how to know you are drowning, getting hit by fire lava and slime,
  being exhausted.
- Fix seeing ghosts (you should only see party memebrs as ghosts not everyone).
- Fix map so it displays discoverd areas on Main map (to discover new areas).
- Fix server flooding. It floods with ""send update to player 58"".
- Fix game object they are all mail box's.
- Item attributes do not work (defence rate dont work, we need to start
  working on items).
- Fix text messages for looting (when you pickup a weapon, it does not show
  anything).
- Bank bag slots and extra bag slots work but do not open and can not be
  removed once added.

//// NPC/MOB fixes:
- Make path finding algorithm for mobs (use the terrain reader).
- Fix auction houses.
- Fix command .addmove.
- Fix AI for mobs, current AI is not really "intelligent" but rather stupid.
- Need to add a state for mobs, currently missing aggressive, neutral or
  passive states.
- Fix command .addsh.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add things here that need to be changed, added, or thought about later.

- Work still open:

  * Make a list of player/unit flags.
  * Make items work.
  * Fix spirit healer.
  * Complete spell rewrite.
  * Start Character/Unit rewrite.
  * Look and integrate/reimplement FOOK FvF patches.
  * Complete object manager rewrite.
  * Fix AI to properly handle multiple targets.
  * Deathworld.

- Add:
  * Generic error trapping, recovering from, reporting, and logging.
  * Scripting

- Change:
  * Server should be split to be potentially built with separate servers in
    separate binaries, communicating with each other over TCP/IP.
  * Network protocol should be separated from world server.

- Fix:
  * Bug tracker needs some cleaning out. Smash a bug, earn a feature.

- Thoughts and Concerns:
  * Code could use some spring cleaning.  Doxygon output, or anything similar,
    could make life easier for people new to the source. It would be nice to
    establish and apply some style standards to things such as variable naming.
  * Code could use some optimization. Would it be worth it to build in a
    profiler and some kind of automatic bottleneck logging?  At some point we
    could use a review of all the code concerning efficiency, consistency, and
    expandability.
  * How many threads should we have? Would it make sense to have a separate
    "functionality" thread from one which handles networking and packet
    queuing? If multiple servers are built into the same binary, they should
    probably only use one networking thread.
  * This could be a lot of work just for a bit of organization, but all the
    pieces of the code are communicating with each other like an old peer to
    peer network protocol. Should appropriate things be centralized around some
    "core" object?
