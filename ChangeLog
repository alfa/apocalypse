MaNGOS 0.0.1  (Sept 13, 2005) https://opensvn.csie.org/traccgi/MaNGOS/trac.cgi/milestone/0.0.1

 MaNGOS 0.0.1 contains a great number of new features, improvements and
 bug fixes. The following list contains all of them:

 * NPC gossips now hash by Guid instead of ID. ID is meaningless and we should revisit its usage.
 * Fixed client crash issue. GameObject still not interactive. Flags issues.
 * Introduced new gameobjecttemplate table as well new map files.
 * Added SCP-to-SQL converter to contrib/scp-to-sql/.
 * MySQL 4.0 branch now is minimum requirement.
 * Server causes client to core on unintialized memory. Also, remove some debug statement which causes problem when the DB is large
 * Creature loot now reads from the creatureloot table. Use a new algorithm to select loot items that mimic the probabilities assigned in each item.
 * Fixed configuration file, added proper settings for packet logging.
 * Added default data for player creation and command help.
 * Added GM command: .addspw #entry-id. Spawns a creature from creaturetemplate table by given #entry-id.
 * Server randomly cores if DBC file failed to load. Fixes by intializing all DBC class internal variables.
 * Daemon version and path to daemon configuration now set by build system on compile time.
 * Allow connections from client release 4544
 * Update solution and project files for latest Visual Studio .NET 2005 Beta 2 release.
 * Fixed compiler error for gcc 4.0 or higher. Calling templated base class methods has to be explicit from 4.0 or higher on.
 * Added contrib/ subdirectory for third-party tools.
 * Applied MaNGOS code indention schema.
 * Initial code checked into repository.
 * Fork from WoW Daemon 0.9.0 branch.
