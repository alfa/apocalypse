What's new ?

1. ACE framework (http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html)
2. New Mysql Lib ( mysql++ http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/)
3. Remove dependency directory so that any deps can be installed anywhere. ( perhaps. I just don't like the idea of having MaNGOS with the deps. ) 

- Is it already a workin MaNGOS ?

Yes, it is. With several issues to be solved.

First, not all the opcodes haven't been changed. 
Second, it's @rev 1939 only
Third, so far only test it on *nix.

- Why change it to ACE ?

Why not ? 

- What does ACE bring to MaNGOS ?

A lot... Specially Design Patterns.

As an example:
- Leader/follower Pattern
- ThreadPool Reactor
- Connector/acceptor
- Singleton
- and much more...
- Using a new configuration file. 
- Better log system
- ...

List of Dependencies
