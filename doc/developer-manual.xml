            <para>MaNGOS is the abbreviation for Massive Network Game Object
            Server. It is a collection of daemons and tools required to build
            a large scale online gaming platform, for games know as MMORPG.
            It's not a fixed system where you can only play one kind of MMORPG
            but nearly any kind of MMORPG as MaNGOS only provides a foundation
            of tools and daemons required to build such services. We do include
            sample game services for well known MMORPGs' available, but we as
            well include everything you need to create a new gaming daemon for
            your own MMORPG.</para>

            <para>The main terms describing MaNGOS are "object orientation" and
            "automation". MaNGOS' goal is to provide a strong and complete
            framework for the development of large scale MMORPG services on
            multiple platforms, and aims to provide learning developers with a
            reference implementation for professional software development.</para>

            <para>Developers will enjoy the possibilities to define custom
            communication schemes for their own game client, as well as the
            abilitiy to use various backends for authentication, as well as
            for identification of access control rights.</para>

            <para>On a higher level, MaNGOS allows users - read MMORPG content
            developers - to create and define custom game content, including
            basic objects, characters, and everything you might think of. The
            only limits are your own imagination.</para>
